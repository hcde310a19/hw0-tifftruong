# Description of your program (part 7)
To count the total number of words in a document, first you'll need a Scanner to process the document as file.
Initiate variable for a counter for each word.
Go through each line and increase the counter for each word you encounter.
After going through every line, print the results of the counter to get the number of total words.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
The exercise was a good refresher and a little difficult just because it has been a while since I've coded.
I've only taken CSE 142, CSE 143 and INFO 201. In terms of writing an English description of the code, it was quite
satisfying because it reminded me of psuedo-coding.

Lastly, from this course I hope to gain a better understanding with HCDE and coding.
I hope to familiarize myself with the skills needed in the human-centered career world.
Also build my confidence is my coding skills as well.
